# Stratege
12th grade Java game project. Co-authors credited where appropriate.
Stratege is a simple turn-based strategy game in the vein of Command And Conquer.
Refer to documentation for instructions on how to play.
The main contributions to this from myself are:
- The procedural terrain generator (which uses an open-source implementation of simplex noise)
- The save/load state system (which saves to the user's main folder)
- Various other parts of the UI and some internal game logic
This code predates most of my formal programming education. Commenting is sparse and spaghetti is prevalent.
I may consider building a cleaned-up, refactored version if need be.
